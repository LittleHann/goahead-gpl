## GoAhead 2.X License

GoAhead version 2.X is obsolete.  If you are using version 2, you cannot apply code or patches from the GoAhead version 4 code base as the GoAhead 2.X license is incompatible. You must either adopt a commercial license for GoAhead version 4 or use the GPL license. You cannot extract patches from this repository and apply to GoAhead 2 code.

While the GoAhead 3/4 APIs are different in syntax, the underlying functionality is the same, the upgrade to version 4 is quite easy.
