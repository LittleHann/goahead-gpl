            <h1>Using CGI Programs</h1>
            <p>The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard for interfacing external applications with web
            servers. CGI was originally developed as part of the NCSA HTTP server and is an old standard for interfacing
            external applications with HTTP servers. It still enjoys considerable use.</p> <p>CGI was created to allow
            dynamic data to be generated in response to HTTP requests and return the results to the clients's browser. Plain
            HTML documents are typically static, while a CGI program allows the response data to be dynamically created.</p>
            <p>CGI scripts are written in any language that can read from the standard-input, write to the
            standard-output, and access environment variables.  This means that virtually any programming language can be
            used, including C, Perl, or even Unix shell scripting.</p>
            <p>However, since CGI was first developed, several better means of creating dynamic web pages have been
            created that are faster and more efficient. Read more about such replacements in 
            <a href="goactions.html">Using GoActions</a>.</p>
            <p>Embedthis GoAhead supports CGI so that existing CGI applications can be fully supported. GoAhead has a
            high-performance and fully featured CGI Handler that alleviates many of the pains with configuring CGI
            setup.</p>

            <h2 >Configuring CGI Programs</h2>
            <p>Requests for CGI programs are identified by a unique URI prefix specified at build time. This is
            typically "cgi-bin". The CGI programs and scripts are stored in special CGI directories outside the
            document root.</p>
            <p>When a URI is requested by a browser that includes the "<em>/cgi-bin/</em>" prefix, the 
            script name immediately after "/cgi-bin/" will be run. For example:</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">

            <h2 >Invoking CGI Programs</h2>
            <p>When a CGI program is run, the GoAhead CGI handler communicates request information to the CGI program
            via Environment Variables.</p>
            
            <a name="env"></a>
            <h2 >CGI Environment Variables</h2>
            <p>CGI uses environment variables to send your program additional parameters. The following environment
            variables are defined:</p>

            <h3>URI Encoding</h3>
            <p>When a URI is sent via HTTP, certain special characters must be escaped so the URI can be processed
            unambiguously by the server. To escape the special characters, the HTTP client should convert them to their
            %hex equivalent. Form and query variables are separated by "&amp;". For example: a=1&amp;b=2 defines two
            form variables "a" and "b" with their values equal to "1" and "2" respectively.</p><a id="cgiProgramming"></a>
            <h2 >CGI Programming</h2>
            <p>CGI program can return almost any possible content type back to the client's browser: plain HTML, audio,
            video or any other format. CGI programs can also control the user's browser and redirect it to another URI.
            To do this, CGI programs return pseudo-HTTP headers that are interpreted by GoAhead before passing the data
            on to the client.</p>
            <p>GoAhead understands the following CGI headers that can be output by the CGI program. They are
            case-insensitive.</p>

        <h2>CGI for VxWorks</h2>
        <p>CGI's standard implementation requires that standalone processes be executed and their outputs returned to the
        browser via the WebServer. In VxWorks, processes are not implemented, but rather tasks are. In addition to
        understanding the mechanisms used in the implementation of VxWorks CGI tasks, developers of CGI processes must be
        aware of the differences between processes on other operating systems and tasks on VxWorks.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>VxWorks tasks can be spawned using code already loaded in memory. On VxWorks systems with no file system,
            the CGI task code can be included in the operating system image and is not necessarily contained in a file.</li>
            <li>If the CGI code is contained in a file, a browser request for it will cause it to be loaded into memory
            prior to its execution. It will be unloaded and reloaded each time it is invoked, which allows the upgrading to
            a new version between invocations.</li>
            <li>The VxWorks taskSpawn API is used to spawn the CGI task.</li>
            <li> An entry point symbol name must be used to spawn the task. The request for the CGI process can define this
            entry point name in the request by including the query string keyword=value pair "cgientry=symbolname", where
            symbolname is a function name in the CGI code that is to be executed. If cgientry is not defined in this way, a
            default entry name will be searched for in the loaded code. The default name is "basename_cgientry", where
            basename is the name of the requested CGI process minus any file extension or path information (e.g., if the
            request is for "cgi-bin/cgitest.out", the default entry point symbol name will be "cgitest_cgientry"). If the
            entry point symbol name is not found or if the requested module cannot be loaded, the CGI request will fail.</li>
            <li>The priority of the spawned task will be the same priority at which WebServer is running.</li>
            <li>The stack size of the spawned task is 20K.</li>
            <li>The task name will be the same as the entry point name.</li>
            <li>The standard CGI environment variables are copied to the task environment. They can be retrieved/modified by
            the getenv/putenv APIs.</li>
            <li>Command line arguments (if any) are passed to the user's entry point via a (int argc, char **argv) standard
            convention, where argc is the number of arguments and argv is an array of strings.</li>
            <li>As in standard CGI processes, the VxWorks CGI task can retrieve additional POST data from the standard input
            device and must write any output to be returned to the client to the standard output device. These devices are
            actually temporary files where stdin and stdout have been redirected.</li>
            <li>User-defined CGI task codes should always be terminated with a return rather than an exit API. This allows
            environment space and redirected I/O files used by the task to be cleaned up and released back to the operating
            system appropriately.</li>

            <h2 >Hints and Tips</h2>
            <p>If you have special data or environment variables that must be passed to your CGI program, you can wrap
            it with a script that defines that environment before invoking your script.</p><a id="otherResources"></a>
