            <h1>Installing on Linux</h1>
            <p>Running GoAhead on Linux is supported by building from source code. </p>
            <p>Please see instructions at <a href="source.html">Building from Source</a>.</p>
<!--
            <p>The GoAhead install distribution for LINUX is published in three formats:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Native RPM format for RPM based systems such as Fedora</li>
                <li>Native Debian format for Debian based systems such as Ubuntu</li>
                <li>Tar format for custom/self installs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is recommended that you use either the native formats (if your system supports it) as these will
            register the software installation with the system's software manager. The self-install format consists of
            tar archives that you can manually extract for maximum control over the placement of the product files.</p>
            <p>All formats contain a binary distribution, documentation and development headers and libraries in the
            one package. During installation you will have the option of installing the full distribution or just
            portions.</p><a id="native"></a>
            <h2 >Installing the RPM or Debian Images</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Uncompress and extract the image:
                    <pre class="ui code segment">
tar xvfz goahead-VERSION-DIST-LINUX-CPU.FMT.tgz
</pre>
                    <p>Where VERSION is the current version (e.g. 1.2.3-1), and DIST is the name of the Linux
                    distribution (e.g. fedora), and FMT is either <b>rpm</b> or <b>deb</b>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Then start the installation with administrator privilege:
                    <pre class="ui code segment">
sudo ./install
</pre>
                </li>
            </ol><a id="self"></a>
            <h2 >Installing the Self-Install Image</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Uncompress and extract the image:
                    <pre class="ui code segment">
tar xvfz goahead-VERSION-DIST-LINUX-CPU.tgz
</pre>
                </li>
                <li>Then start the installation with administrator privilege:
                    <pre class="ui code segment">
sudo ./install
</pre>
                </li>
            </ol><a id="removing"></a>
            <h2 >Removing GoAhead</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Change directory to the installation directory for GoAhead. This is usually
                <b>/usr/lib/goahead</b></li>
                <li>Run the uninstall script in the install directory for goahead:
                    <pre class="ui code segment">
sudo ./uninstall
</pre>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 >Running GoAhead</h2>
            <p>To start GoAhead type:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
sudo goahead --home /etc/goahead
</pre>
            <p>GoAhead is configured by default to listen on port 80. To test that it is serving pages, point your
            browser at http://localhost/.
            <p>To get all the options for GoAhead read the man page via:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
man goahead
</pre>or get the command help via:
            <pre class="ui code segment">
goahead --help
</pre>
