            <h1>Running GoAhead</h1>
            <p>GoAhead is built to listen on default ports specified at build time. These are typically set to port 80 for
            HTTP and port 443 for SSL. However, you can override these via GoAhead command line options. If <em>goahead</em> is invoked
            with an IP address or port number on the command line, GoAhead will listen on that IP address and not the
            default.</p>
            <p>The GoAhead command line usage is:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
goahead [options] [documents] [IP]:[PORT]
</pre>
            <p>If the PORT component is omitted, GoAhead will listen on port 80. If the IP address is omitted and a port is
            supplied, GoAhead will listen on all network interfaces. An optional document root directory can be supplied for
            the location of the web pages.</p>

                        is exceeded, the log file will be rotated to logName.old and a new log file will be started.
                        The log level is a number between 0 and 9 where 0 is the least verbose. The -l option is an
                        alias for --log.</td>
