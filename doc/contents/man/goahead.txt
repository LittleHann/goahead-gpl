DESCRIPTION
       GoAhead  is  popular,  simple  embedded HTTP web server.  It is a fast,
       small-footprint,  single-threaded,  standards-based,  portable   server
       developed  for use by embedded devices and applications.  It can run as
       a stand-alone web server or the GoAhead  library  can  be  embedded  in
       applications.

       GoAhead  supports HTTP/1.1, SSL, digest, basic and web-form authentica-
       tion, chunked transfers, file upload and sandbox security limits.

       When goahead is built, it  is  configured  to  open  a  port  for  HTTP
       requests  and  optionally  one  for SSL. However, if goahead is invoked
       with an IP address or port number on the  command  line,  GoAhead  will
       listen  on these ports instead.  If the PORT component is omitted, GoA-
       head will listen on port 80. If the IP address is omitted and a port is
       supplied, GoAhead will listen on all network interfaces.

OPTIONS
       --auth filename
              Define  the  name of the authentication configuration file. This
              is by default auth.txt.  If GoAhead is built  with  PAM  support
              (Unix  Pluggable Authentication Modules), then passwords will be
              authenticated from the system password database.

       --debugger
              Run GoAhead in debug mode and disable all  timeouts.  This  dis-
              ables  request  and session timeouts.  The -d option is an alias
              for --debugger.

       --log logSpec
              Name the GoAhead log  file.  This  will  override  the  ErrorLog
              directive  in  the configuration file.  When the maximum size is
              exceeded, the log file will be rotated to logName.old and a  new
              log  file  will be started. The -l option is an alias for --log.
              The syntax is:

              --log logName[:logLevel]

       --home directory
              Define the server home directory for GoAhead.

       --route routeFile
              This option overrides the default route configuration file  name
              of "route.txt". When GoAhead starts, it reads the route configu-
              ration file to load URI routes. These routes define what actions
              should be taken when various client requests are received.

       --verbose
              Shorthand  for  --log  stdout:4.  The  -v option is an alias for
              --verbose.

       --version
              Output the product version number.
